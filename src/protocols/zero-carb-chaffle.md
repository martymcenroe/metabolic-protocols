## Protocol Overview
A flavorful bread replacement for the zero-carb diet. Uses a cheese blend for both structure and taste, with added fat for richness. Scaled for a full-size waffle maker (GreenPan or similar 4-segment iron).

## Ingredients (Full-Size Waffle)

### Base
* **4** Large Eggs
* **1 Cup** Full-Fat Mozzarella (shredded) - provides structure and crispness
* **1 Cup** Flavorful Cheese (shredded) - see Cheese Blend Options below
* **2 Tbsp** Butter (melted) or Cream Cheese (softened)
* **¼ tsp** Salt (critical for flavor - do not skip)

### Cheese Blend Options

| Blend | Flavor Profile | Best For |
|-------|----------------|----------|
| **Mozzarella + Sharp Cheddar** | Bold but balanced | Sandwiches, burgers |
| **Mozzarella + Aged White Cheddar** | Savory, nutty | All-purpose |
| **Mozzarella + Gruyère** | Rich, slightly sweet | Croque madame base |
| **Mozzarella + Parmesan** | Salty, umami | Italian dishes, pizza base |
| **Mozzarella + Pepper Jack** | Spicy kick | Tex-Mex, breakfast |

*Note:* Pure mozzarella (especially part-skim) = cardboard. Always blend with a flavorful cheese.

### Optional Flavor Boosters (Savory)
* **½ tsp** Garlic Powder
* **½ tsp** Onion Powder
* **1 Tbsp** Everything Bagel Seasoning (sprinkle on top before closing lid)
* **1 tsp** Italian Seasoning
* **2 Tbsp** Cooked Bacon Crumbles

### Optional Flavor Boosters (Sweet)
* **1 tsp** Vanilla Extract
* **½ tsp** Cinnamon
* **2 Tbsp** Confectioner's Swerve
* *Use mozzarella only for sweet version (no cheddar)*

## Cheese Notes

| Type | Flavor | Fat | Result |
|------|--------|-----|--------|
| **Part-Skim Mozzarella** | Bland/cardboard | Low | Avoid - tasteless |
| **Full-Fat Mozzarella** | Mild, neutral | Higher | Good for structure |
| **Sharp Cheddar** | Strong, tangy | High | Powerful - use in blend |
| **Aged White Cheddar** | Savory, complex | High | Excellent in blend |
| **Gruyère** | Nutty, rich | High | Premium option |

## Execution Protocol

### 1. The Pre-Heat
* Plug in the waffle maker (GreenPan or similar full-size iron).
* **Status Check:** Wait for indicator light or until fully heated.

### 2. The Batter
* In a medium bowl, whisk **4 Eggs** until uniform.
* Add **Melted Butter** (or softened cream cheese) and **Salt**. Whisk to combine.
* Fold in **2 Cups Total Shredded Cheese Blend**.
* Add any optional flavor boosters and stir.
* *Consistency:* Should be a thick, pourable batter with visible cheese shreds.

### 3. The Cook
* Lightly grease waffle iron if needed (butter or cooking spray).
* Pour batter evenly across the iron surface.
* If using Everything Bagel Seasoning, sprinkle on top before closing.
* Close the lid.
* **Duration:** 5 to 6 minutes for full-size iron.
* **Visual Cue:** Do not open until steam stops escaping from the sides.
* **Target:** Deep golden brown, cheese edges slightly caramelized.

### 4. The Rest (Critical)
* Remove chaffle carefully with a fork or silicone spatula.
* Place on a **Wire Rack** for 60-90 seconds.
* *Mechanism:* The cheese must cool slightly to recrystallize and become crispy. Placing directly on a plate traps steam → soggy chaffle.

## Scaling

| Waffle Maker Size | Eggs | Cheese Total | Butter | Salt |
|-------------------|------|--------------|--------|------|
| Mini (Dash) | 1 | ½ cup | ½ Tbsp | pinch |
| Standard (Belgian) | 2 | 1 cup | 1 Tbsp | ⅛ tsp |
| Full-Size (GreenPan 4-segment) | 4 | 2 cups | 2 Tbsp | ¼ tsp |

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| Tastes like cardboard | Part-skim mozzarella, no salt, no fat | Use full-fat, add salt, add butter, blend cheeses |
| Too cheesy/overpowering | Too much cheddar | Use 50/50 mozzarella blend |
| Soggy | Skipped wire rack, or under-cooked | Cool on rack, cook longer until steam stops |
| Tearing when removed | Opened too early | Wait for steam to stop completely |
| Sticking to iron | Iron not hot enough or not greased | Preheat fully, add light grease |
| Rubbery texture | Over-mixed eggs, or too much egg | Fold gently, ensure cheese ratio is correct |

## Storage

* **Fresh:** Best eaten within 30 minutes of cooking.
* **Refrigerator:** Store in airtight container for 3-4 days. Reheat in toaster or air fryer.
* **Freezer:** Freeze flat, separated by parchment. Toast from frozen.
