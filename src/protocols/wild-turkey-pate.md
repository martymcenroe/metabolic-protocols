## Protocol Overview
A nutrient-dense organ meat spread utilizing the "Wild Turkey 101" bourbon for flavor depth (alcohol sugars burn off) and heavy cream for smooth emulsification. Excellent vehicle for nutrient intake without carbohydrates.

## Ingredients
* **1 lb** Chicken Livers (cleaned/trimmed)
* **Turkey Giblets** (Heart and Liver reserved from the bird)
* **4 Strips** Bacon (chopped)
* **4 Tbsp** Butter (plus extra for sealing)
* **¼ Cup** Wild Turkey 101 Bourbon
* **½ Cup** Heavy Whipping Cream
* **2 Cloves** Garlic (minced)
* **1 Tbsp** Fresh Herbs (Sage, Thyme, Rosemary - chopped)
* **Salt & Pepper** to taste

## Execution Protocol

### 1. The Render
* In a large skillet over medium-high heat, fry the **chopped bacon** until crisp.
* Remove bacon bits with a slotted spoon (reserve for snacking or topping). Leave the fat in the pan.

### 2. The Sauté
* Add **4 Tbsp Butter** to the bacon fat.
* Add **Livers**, **Heart**, **Garlic**, and **Herbs**.
* Sauté until livers are browned on the outside but still slightly pink in the center (approx 5-7 minutes).
* **Warning:** Do not overcook liver, or it becomes metallic and grainy.

### 3. The Deglaze (Flavor Extraction)
* Pour in the **Wild Turkey 101**.
* Scrape up any browned bits (fond) from the bottom of the pan.
* Simmer for 1-2 minutes to evaporate the alcohol.

### 4. The Emulsion
* Transfer the entire hot mixture (livers + liquid) to a food processor or blender.
* Add the **Heavy Whipping Cream**.
* Pulse/Blend until perfectly smooth and silky.
* Taste and adjust salt/pepper.

### 5. The Set
* Pour into ramekins or small jars.
* **Optional Seal:** Pour a thin layer of melted butter over the top to prevent oxidation (discoloration).
* Refrigerate for at least **2 hours** to firm up.

## Serving Suggestion
* Serve spread on **Zero-Carb Chaffles**, Parmesan Crisps, or cucumber slices.
