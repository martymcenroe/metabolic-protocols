## Protocol Overview
A dense, high-fat cheesecake that replaces the graham cracker crust with a ground pecan and butter base. Can be sweetened with either Allulose or Swerve Confectioner's (erythritol-based). Features a stabilized whipped cream border and optional blueberry compote.

## Ingredients

### The Crust
* **2 Cups** Raw Pecans (Ground into meal/flour)
* **4 Tbsp** Salted Butter (Melted)
* **3 Tbsp** Sweetener (See Sweetener Options below)
* **Pinch** Salt

### The Filling
* **3 Blocks (24 oz)** Full-Fat Cream Cheese (Softened to Room Temp)
* **1 Cup** Sweetener (See Sweetener Options below)
* **3** Large Eggs (Room Temp)
* **½ Cup** Heavy Whipping Cream
* **1 Tbsp** Vanilla Extract
* **1 Tbsp** Lemon Juice (freshly squeezed)

### The Topping (Whipped Border)
* **1 Cup** Heavy Whipping Cream
* **2 Tbsp** Sweetener (See Sweetener Options below)
* **1 tsp** Vanilla Extract
* **Pinch** Cream of Tartar (Stabilizer for piping)

### Sweetener Options
**Option 1: Confectioner's Swerve (Recommended)**
* **Advantages:** Stays smooth when chilled, no recrystallization, no browning during bake
* **Carb Impact:** Adds ~0.8g carbs per slice from tapioca starch (Total: ~2.8g net carbs per slice)
* **Substitution:** 1:1 replacement for all measurements above

**Option 2: Allulose**
* **Advantages:** True zero-carb, smooth texture, mimics sugar closely
* **Disadvantage:** Browns excessively during baking (top will be dark brown even when filling is perfectly cooked)
* **Substitution:** 1:1 replacement for all measurements above
* **Note:** Use powdered allulose for the topping if available

## Preparation and Timing

### 1. Butter Melting (Advance Prep)
* Preheat oven to **200°F (95°C)**.
* Place **4 Tbsp butter** in an oven-safe bowl.
* Once oven reaches temperature, **turn oven off**.
* Place butter in the warm oven for **10-15 minutes** to fully melt.
* *Alternative:* Leave oven on at 170°F for 5 minutes with butter inside, then turn off.

### 2. Eggs to Room Temperature (30 Minutes Before)
* Remove **3 eggs** from refrigerator.
* Place on counter for **30 minutes** to reach room temperature.
* *Quick Method:* Submerge eggs in warm (not hot) water for 10 minutes.

### 3. Cream Cheese to Room Temperature (60 Minutes Before)
* Unwrap all **3 blocks (24 oz) cream cheese**.
* Place in stand mixer bowl (or large mixing bowl).
* Let sit on counter for **60 minutes** to soften completely.
* *Test:* Should indent easily when pressed with a finger (no hard center).

## Execution Protocol

### 1. The Crust Assembly
* Preheat oven to **325°F (165°C)**.
* **Grind:** Pulse pecans in a blender/food processor until they resemble coarse sand. *Caution: Do not over-blend or you will make pecan butter.*
* **Mix:** In a bowl, combine pecan meal, melted butter, sweetener, and salt.
* **Press:** Firmly press the mixture into the bottom of a **9-inch Springform Pan**.
* **Par-Bake:** Bake for **10 minutes**. Remove and let cool slightly. *Leave oven on.*

### 2. The Filling Emulsion
* In a large mixing bowl (or stand mixer), beat the **Cream Cheese** and **Sweetener** until completely smooth.
* **Add Eggs:** One at a time, beating lightly after each addition. *Constraint: Do not overbeat (introduces air bubbles which cause cracks).*
* **Add Liquids:** Stir in **Heavy Cream**, **Vanilla**, and **Lemon Juice**. Mix until just combined.
* **Pour:** Pour batter over the par-baked crust. Smooth the top.

### 3. The Bake
* Place pan on the center rack.
* Bake at **325°F** for **50 to 60 minutes**.
* **Pull Criteria:** The edges should be set and slightly puffy, but the center (inner 2-3 inches) should still jiggle slightly like Jell-O.

### 4. The Controlled Cool (Anti-Crack Protocol)
* Turn off the oven.
* **Crack the door:** Prop the oven door open about 1 inch (use a wooden spoon if needed).
* **Rest:** Leave the cheesecake in the cooling oven for **30 minutes**.
* **Remove:** Transfer to a wire rack on the counter to cool completely.
* **Chill:** Refrigerate for at least **4 hours** (preferably overnight) to set.

### 5. The Decoration
* **Whip:** Beat the topping heavy cream, sweetener, vanilla, and cream of tartar until stiff peaks form.
* **Pipe:** Use a piping bag with a Star Tip (e.g., 1M) to pipe rosettes around the border.
* **Serve:** Slice and top with **Zero-Carb Blueberry Compote**.

## Notes on Allulose Browning

If using allulose as your sweetener, expect the top surface of the cheesecake to turn dark brown during baking, even when the interior is properly cooked. This is due to:

1. **Maillard Reaction:** Allulose reacts with proteins (from eggs and cream cheese) at lower temperatures than regular sugar
2. **Caramelization:** Allulose caramelizes at ~240°F, well below the 325°F baking temperature

**Note:** Tenting with aluminum foil does NOT prevent this browning, as it is caused by the chemical reaction with heat, not exposure to air. The browning is purely cosmetic and does not affect flavor or texture. If appearance is important, use Confectioner's Swerve instead.
