## Protocol Overview
A dense, high-fat cheesecake that replaces the graham cracker crust with a ground pecan and butter base. Sweetened with Allulose to ensure a smooth, non-crystallizing texture that mimics real sugar. Features a stabilized whipped cream border and optional blueberry compote.

## Ingredients

### The Crust
* **2 Cups** Raw Pecans (Ground into meal/flour)
* **4 Tbsp** Salted Butter (Melted)
* **3 Tbsp** Allulose (Granular)
* **Pinch** Salt

### The Filling
* **3 Blocks (24 oz)** Full-Fat Cream Cheese (Softened to Room Temp)
* **1 Cup** Allulose
* **3** Large Eggs (Room Temp)
* **½ Cup** Heavy Whipping Cream
* **1 Tbsp** Vanilla Extract
* **1 Tbsp** Lemon Juice (freshly squeezed)

### The Topping (Whipped Border)
* **1 Cup** Heavy Whipping Cream
* **2 Tbsp** Allulose (Powdered preferred, granular works)
* **1 tsp** Vanilla Extract
* **Pinch** Cream of Tartar (Stabilizer for piping)

## Execution Protocol

### 1. The Crust Assembly
* Preheat oven to **325°F (165°C)**.
* **Grind:** Pulse pecans in a blender/food processor until they resemble coarse sand. *Caution: Do not over-blend or you will make pecan butter.*
* **Mix:** In a bowl, combine pecan meal, melted butter, allulose, and salt.
* **Press:** Firmly press the mixture into the bottom of a **9-inch Springform Pan**.
* **Par-Bake:** Bake for **10 minutes**. Remove and let cool slightly. *Leave oven on.*

### 2. The Filling Emulsion
* In a large mixing bowl (or stand mixer), beat the **Cream Cheese** and **Allulose** until completely smooth.
* **Add Eggs:** One at a time, beating lightly after each addition. *Constraint: Do not overbeat (introduces air bubbles which cause cracks).*
* **Add Liquids:** Stir in **Heavy Cream**, **Vanilla**, and **Lemon Juice**. Mix until just combined.
* **Pour:** Pour batter over the par-baked crust. Smooth the top.

### 3. The Bake
* Place pan on the center rack.
* Bake at **325°F** for **50 to 60 minutes**.
* **Pull Criteria:** The edges should be set and slightly puffy, but the center (inner 2-3 inches) should still jiggle slightly like Jell-O.

### 4. The Controlled Cool (Anti-Crack Protocol)
* Turn off the oven.
* **Crack the door:** Prop the oven door open about 1 inch (use a wooden spoon if needed).
* **Rest:** Leave the cheesecake in the cooling oven for **30 minutes**.
* **Remove:** Transfer to a wire rack on the counter to cool completely.
* **Chill:** Refrigerate for at least **4 hours** (preferably overnight) to set.

### 5. The Decoration
* **Whip:** Beat the topping heavy cream, sweetener, vanilla, and cream of tartar until stiff peaks form.
* **Pipe:** Use a piping bag with a Star Tip (e.g., 1M) to pipe rosettes around the border.
* **Serve:** Slice and top with **Zero-Carb Blueberry Compote**.
