## Protocol Overview
A Zero-Carb "Forcemeat" stuffing designed to replace bread-based stuffings. By using ground turkey instead of pork, it maintains the pure poultry flavor profile while allowing the fat to baste the bird from the inside.

## Ingredients
* **1 lb** Ground Turkey (85% lean / 15% fat preferred).
* **1** Large Egg (Binder).
* **½ Cup** Grated Parmesan Cheese (Moisture absorber/Binder).
* **2 Tbsp** Fresh Herbs (Sage, Rosemary, Thyme - chopped).
* **½ tsp** Salt.
* **½ tsp** Black Pepper.

## Execution Protocol

### 1. The Mix
* In a large bowl, combine the **Ground Turkey**, **Egg**, **Parmesan**, **Herbs**, and **Seasoning**.
* Mix by hand until the mixture becomes tacky/sticky.

### 2. The Stuffing
* **Constraint:** Do not pack tightly.
* Loosely fill the main cavity of the turkey with the mixture.

### 3. The Roast
* Roast the turkey according to standard protocols (e.g., Roasting Bag).
* **Critical Safety Check:** The bird is not done until the **center of the stuffing** reads **165°F (74°C)**.
* *Note:* This typically adds 15-30 minutes to the total cooking time compared to an unstuffed bird.
