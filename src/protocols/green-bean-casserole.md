## Protocol Overview
A flour-free engineering of the holiday classic. Eliminates the high-carb "Cream of Mushroom" soup by utilizing a heavy cream reduction thickened with Parmesan and cream cheese. Can be prepared on direct heat or using a double boiler.

## Ingredients

### Green Beans
* **1.5 to 2 lbs** Green Beans (trimmed)
  * **Standard Green Beans:** Thicker, heartier, require longer blanching
  * **French Green Beans (Haricots Verts):** Thinner, more delicate texture, cook faster (recommended)

### Sauce
* **8–10 oz** White Bella Mushrooms (sliced thin)
* **4 Tbsp** Salted Butter
* **1.5 Cups** Heavy Whipping Cream
* **¾ Cup** Grated Parmesan Cheese (The thickener)
* **3 oz** Cream Cheese (For body - prevents thin/soupy sauce)
* **2 Cloves** Garlic (minced)
* **1 tsp** Fresh Thyme (chopped)
* **Salt & Black Pepper** to taste

### Topping
* **Crushed Pork Rinds** or **Parmesan Crisps** (for crunch)

## Parmesan Crisps

If making your own:
* Spread shredded parmesan in small mounds on a parchment-lined baking sheet.
* Broil for **3-5 minutes** until melted and golden (watch carefully - burns fast).
* Turn oven off. Leave crisps inside for **15 minutes** to harden.
* Remove to a wire rack to cool completely. They will crisp as they cool.
* Break into pieces for topping.

## Execution Protocol

### 1. The Blanch (Texture Control)

Blanching time depends on bean type and desired texture:

| Bean Type | Tender-Crisp | Soft/Traditional |
|-----------|--------------|------------------|
| **French (Haricots Verts)** | 4-5 minutes | 6-8 minutes |
| **Standard Green Beans** | 8-10 minutes | 12-15 minutes |

* Bring a large pot of salted water to a rolling boil.
* Add **Green Beans**.
* **Test:** Bite a bean before draining to check texture.
* **Drain immediately.** Shock in ice water to stop cooking, then drain **bone-dry**.
* *Critical:* Wet beans = watery sauce. Pat dry with towels if needed.

### 2. The Mushroom Sauté (Flavor Base)
* In a skillet over **Medium-High** heat, melt **4 Tbsp Butter**.
* Add **Sliced Mushrooms**.
* Sauté for **6–8 minutes** until water evaporates and mushrooms brown.
* Add **Garlic** and **Thyme** in the final minute.
* Set aside.

### 3. The Sauce

#### Option A: Direct Heat (Simpler)
* In a large saucepan over **Medium-Low** heat, add **1.5 Cups Heavy Cream**.
* Simmer for **5-8 minutes**, stirring occasionally, until reduced by about ¼.
* Add **Cream Cheese**, whisking until melted and smooth.
* Add **Sautéed Mushroom Mixture**.
* Stir in **¾ Cup Parmesan Cheese**.
* Continue stirring until sauce is thick and coats the back of a spoon.
* *Caution:* Stir frequently to prevent scorching on bottom.

#### Option B: Double Boiler (Gentler)
* **Setup:** Place a metal or glass bowl over a pot of simmering water. Bowl should NOT touch the water.
* In the bowl, combine **Heavy Cream** and **Cream Cheese**. Stir until cream cheese melts.
* Add **Sautéed Mushroom Mixture**.
* Add **¾ Cup Parmesan Cheese**.
* Stir frequently until sauce is thick, velvety, and coats the back of a spoon.
* *Note:* This takes longer but eliminates scorching risk.

**Note:** A steamer insert (with holes) is NOT a double boiler. You need a solid-bottom bowl or pot.

### 4. The Integration
* Add the blanched, **dry** Green Beans into the sauce.
* Toss to coat evenly.
* *Holding Pattern:* Can be kept warm over low heat until service.

### 5. The Finish (Optional Bake)
* Transfer to a casserole dish.
* Top with crushed pork rinds or parmesan crisps.
* Bake at **350°F (175°C)** for 15 minutes until bubbling (if not serving immediately).

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| Sauce too thin/soupy | Not reduced enough, not enough thickener | Reduce cream longer, add more parmesan or cream cheese |
| Beans too crisp | Under-blanched | Increase blanching time, test before draining |
| Watery casserole | Beans not dried properly | Pat beans completely dry before adding to sauce |
| Sauce scorched | Heat too high (direct method) | Use lower heat, stir constantly, or switch to double boiler |
