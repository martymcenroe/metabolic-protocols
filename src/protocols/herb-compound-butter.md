## Protocol Overview
A fat-soluble flavor delivery system. By embedding fresh herbs and salt directly into butter, flavor compounds (terpenes) are extracted and preserved. Essential for sub-dermal application on poultry (under the skin) or finishing steaks/eggs.

## Ingredients
* **1 Stick (4 oz)** Salted Butter (Softened to Room Temp)
* **1 Tbsp** Fresh Rosemary (Leaves stripped, finely chopped)
* **1 Tbsp** Fresh Thyme (Leaves stripped, finely chopped)
* **1 Tbsp** Fresh Sage (Finely chopped)
* **1 tsp** Kosher Salt (Adjust based on butter salinity)
* **½ tsp** Coarse Black Pepper
* **Optional:** 1 Clove Garlic (Minced/Paste)

## Execution Protocol

### 1. The Mise-en-place
* **Chop:** Ensure all herbs are chopped very fine to maximize surface area for oil extraction.
* **Soften:** Butter must be malleable but not melted. If too cold, microwave in 5-second bursts.

### 2. The Integration
* In a small bowl, combine the **Butter**, **Herbs**, **Salt**, **Pepper**, and **Garlic**.
* Mash with a fork until the herbs are evenly distributed throughout the yellow matrix.

### 3. Application A: The "Turkey Under-Skin" Method
* **Target:** Between the breast meat and the skin.
* **Action:** Slide hand under the skin to loosen. Push the butter mixture deep into the pockets.
* *Result:* As the butter melts, it bastes the lean meat directly while the skin traps the herbal steam.

### 4. Application B: The "Log" (Storage)
* Place the butter mixture onto a square of plastic wrap or parchment paper.
* Roll into a tight log (cylinder). Twist the ends to seal.
* **Refrigerate:** Will harden in 30 minutes.
* **Usage:** Slice "coins" of butter to place on top of hot steaks, pork chops, or fried eggs.

## Storage
* **Fridge:** 2 weeks.
* **Freezer:** 6 months (Double wrap).
