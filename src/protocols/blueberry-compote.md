## Protocol Overview
A "stealth" sugar-free topping designed to accompany the Pecan Cheesecake. Utilizes the natural pectin in blueberries and the thermal reduction of Allulose to create a thick, jam-like consistency without cornstarch or sugar.

## Ingredients
* **1 Cup** Fresh or Frozen Blueberries
* **2 Tbsp** Allulose (Granular)
* **1 Tbsp** Water
* **1 tsp** Lemon Juice (Fresh)
* **Pinch** Salt (Enhances sweetness)

## Execution Protocol

### 1. The Mixture
* In a small saucepan over **Medium** heat, combine **Blueberries**, **Allulose**, **Water**, and **Salt**.
* Stir until the allulose dissolves and the liquid begins to bubble.

### 2. The Reduction (Compote Physics)
* Reduce heat to **Low/Simmer**.
* Cook for **8 to 10 minutes**.
* **Mechanical Action:** As they soften, use the back of a wooden spoon or spatula to crush about **50%** of the berries against the side of the pot.
    * *Why:* This releases natural pectin and juice, thickening the sauce while leaving some whole berries for texture.

### 3. The Brightening
* Remove from heat.
* Stir in the **Lemon Juice**.
* *Chemistry:* Adding acid *after* cooking preserves the fresh "high note" flavor that would otherwise cook off.

### 4. Cooling Phase
* Allow to cool for at least **15 minutes** before serving.
* **Viscosity Check:** The sauce will thicken significantly as it cools (Allulose behaves like sugar syrup).
* Serve warm or chilled over cheesecake or yogurt.
