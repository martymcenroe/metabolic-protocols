## Protocol Overview
A rigorous extraction protocol designed to maximize collagen and gelatin yield from a turkey carcass. Utilizes a low-temperature, long-duration simmer (18+ hours) to fully dissolve connective tissue for joint health and recovery.

## Ingredients
* **1** Turkey Carcass (Bones, cartilage, connective tissue, skin).
* **Water** (Sufficient to cover bones + 2 inches).
* **Salt** (To taste, added at the end).
* **Optional:** Apple Cider Vinegar (1 Tbsp) to aid mineral extraction.

## Execution Protocol

### 1. The Simmer (Extraction Phase)
* Place carcass in a stockpot. Cover with water by 2 inches.
* Bring to a boil, then immediately reduce to **LOW**.
* **Target Temp:** 180°F - 200°F (Barely bubbling).
* **Duration:** 12 to 24 hours.
    * *Overnight Option:* Place covered oven-safe pot in oven at **200°F** for safety while sleeping.

### 2. The Snap Test (Validation)
* After 12+ hours, remove a thick bone (e.g., wing or rib).
* Attempt to break it.
* **Pass Criteria:** Bone crumbles or snaps easily with no elasticity.
* **Fail Criteria:** Bone bends or is rigid. Continue cooking.

### 3. Filtration & Storage
* Strain solids through a fine-mesh sieve. Discard bones/solids.
* **Cooling Constraint:** Allow liquid to cool to **110°F** (warm to touch) before transferring to glass jars to prevent thermal shock.
* **Freezing:** Leave **2 inches of headspace** in jars to account for expansion.
* **The Fat Cap:** Allow the fat to solidify on top. Do not discard; it seals the broth and provides zero-carb fuel.
