## Protocol Overview
A flour-free engineering of the holiday classic. Eliminates the high-carb "Cream of Mushroom" soup by utilizing a heavy cream reduction thickened with Parmesan. Uses a double-boiler technique to maintain a stable emulsion without scorching.

## Ingredients
* **1.5 to 2 lbs** Fresh Green Beans (trimmed)
* **8–10 oz** White Bella Mushrooms (sliced thin)
* **4 Tbsp** Salted Butter
* **1.5 Cups** Heavy Whipping Cream
* **½ Cup** Grated Parmesan Cheese (The binder)
* **2 Cloves** Garlic (minced)
* **1 tsp** Fresh Thyme (chopped)
* **Salt & Black Pepper** to taste
* **Optional Topping:** Crushed Pork Rinds or Parmesan Crisps (for crunch)

## Execution Protocol

### 1. The Blanch (Texture Control)
* Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.
* Add **Green Beans**.
* Boil for **5 minutes** (until bright green but crisp).
* **Drain immediately.** Shock in cold water if possible, or drain bone-dry.
* *Note:* The double boiler will not cook raw beans; pre-cooking is mandatory.

### 2. The Mushroom Sauté (Flavor Base)
* In a skillet over **Medium-High** heat, melt **4 Tbsp Butter**.
* Add **Sliced Mushrooms**.
* Sauté for **6–8 minutes** until water evaporates and mushrooms brown.
* Add **Garlic** and **Thyme** in the final minute.

### 3. The Sauce (Double Boiler Method)
* Set up a double boiler (simmering water in bottom pot).
* In the **Top Pot**, combine:
    * The **Sautéed Mushroom Mixture**
    * **1.5 Cups Heavy Cream**
* Stir frequently until hot.
* Add **½ Cup Parmesan Cheese**.
* Stir until the sauce is thick, velvety, and coats the back of a spoon.

### 4. The Integration
* Add the blanched **Green Beans** into the top pot with the sauce.
* Toss to coat evenly.
* *Holding Pattern:* Can be kept warm in the double boiler until service.

### 5. The Finish (Optional Bake)
* Transfer to a casserole dish.
* Top with crushed pork rinds or extra parmesan.
* Bake at **350°F (175°C)** for 15 minutes to bubble (if not serving directly from boiler).
