## Protocol Overview

A Moby Dick-inspired chowder that eliminates starchy potatoes, flour roux, and ultra-processed thickeners. Uses the "Radish Maneuver" (boiling radishes in stock to neutralize their bite and mimic potato texture) and a thermal heavy cream reduction for natural viscosity.

## Ingredients

* **1 lb** Cod Fillets (or Haddock/Halibut), cut into 2-inch chunks.
* **4 Strips** Thick-Cut Bacon (chopped).
* **2 Bunches** Red Radishes (approx 1 lb / 20-24 radishes).
* *Prep:* Trim ends. Cut into quarters or halves to match "bite-sized potato" dimensions.


* **1 Medium** Onion (diced).
* **2 Stalks** Celery (diced).
* **2 Cups** Zero-Carb Turkey Stock (or Chicken Stock).
* **1 Cup** Heavy Whipping Cream.
* **2 Tbsp** Herb Compound Butter (See: `herb-compound-butter.md`).
* **1 Bay Leaf**.
* **Salt & Black Pepper** to taste.

## Execution Protocol

### 1. The Render (Flavor Base)

* In a heavy soup pot or Dutch Oven over **Medium** heat, fry the **Bacon** until crisp.
* Remove bacon with a slotted spoon (reserve for topping). **Leave the fat in the pot.**

### 2. The Aromatic Sweat

* Add **Onion**, **Celery**, and **Radishes** to the hot bacon fat.
* Sauté for **5–7 minutes** until onions are translucent.
* *Note:* The radishes are starting to cook here, but the real transformation happens in the boil.

### 3. The Extraction (Radish Maneuver)

* Pour in the **Turkey Stock**.
* Add the **Bay Leaf**.
* Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer.
* **Cover and cook for 12–15 minutes.**
* *Test:* Pierce a large radish chunk with a fork. It must be "potato tender." If it offers resistance, keep simmering. We need them soft to mimic the mouthfeel of boiled potatoes.

### 4. The Reduction (Natural Thickening)

* Remove the lid.
* Stir in the **Heavy Cream**.
* Maintain a gentle simmer (uncovered) for **5–8 minutes**.
* *Mechanism:* This evaporates excess water and concentrates the cream/stock mixture. The soup will thicken naturally as it reduces.

### 5. The Poach

* Gently slide the **Cod Chunks** into the hot liquid.
* **Do not stir aggressively** (fish breaks easily).
* Simmer for **4–5 minutes** until the cod flakes easily and is opaque.

### 6. The Finish

* Turn off the heat.
* Stir in the **Herb Compound Butter** until melted (adds sheen and herbal depth).
* Taste for salt/pepper.
* Serve garnished with the reserved **Crispy Bacon**.
