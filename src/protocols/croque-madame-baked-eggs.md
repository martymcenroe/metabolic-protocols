## Protocol Overview
A zero-carb adaptation of the classic French bistro sandwich. This version replaces the flour-based béchamel with a high-fat reduction of cream and cream cheese, eliminating the starch while maintaining the rich, savory texture.

## Ingredients

### Zero-Carb Cheesy Cream Sauce
* **2 Tbsp** Salted or Unsalted Butter
* **4 oz (½ cup)** Full-Fat Cream Cheese (Softened)
* **1 ½ Cups** Heavy Whipping Cream
* **1 Tbsp** Dijon Mustard (Check label for 0g sugar)
* **1 tsp** White Wine Vinegar or Lemon Juice
* **½ tsp** Kosher Salt
* **⅛ tsp** Grated Nutmeg
* **1 Cup** Grated Gruyère, Comté, or Old White Cheddar

### Eggs and Ham
* **4 to 8** Large Eggs
* **½ Cup** Smoked Ham or Cooked Bacon (cut into matchsticks)

### Serving
* Coarsely ground black pepper
* Fresh parsley (optional)

## Execution Protocol

### 1. The Sauce Base (Reduction)
* Preheat oven to **425ºF (220ºC)**.
* In a 10-inch cast-iron skillet, combine **Butter**, **Cream Cheese**, and **Heavy Cream** over medium heat.
* **Whisk frequently** until smooth.
* **Correction Note:** Do not add water. Rely on the reduction of the cream for thickness.

### 2. The Thickening
* Stir in **Dijon**, **Vinegar**, **Salt**, and **Nutmeg**.
* Simmer gently for **2–4 minutes** until slightly thickened.
* Remove from heat.
* Stir in the **Grated Cheese** until melted and smooth.

### 3. The Assembly
* Crack eggs evenly over the sauce.
* Sprinkle ham or bacon matchsticks over the top.

### 4. The Bake
* Transfer skillet to the oven (Center Rack).
* Bake for **15 to 18 minutes**.
* **Pull Criteria:** Sauce is bubbling, egg whites are set, yolks are still slightly runny (or to preference).

### 5. Serving
* Sprinkle with black pepper.
* Serve immediately (scoop directly from skillet).
* *Pairing:* Excellent served over **Zero-Carb Chaffles** to soak up the sauce.
