## Protocol Overview
A flourless, low-density bread substitute relying on the mechanical aeration of egg whites stabilized by potassium bitartrate (Cream of Tartar).

## Ingredients
* **3** Large Eggs (Separated into Yolks and Whites)
* **3 Tbsp** Cream Cheese (Softened / Room Temp)
* **¼ tsp** Cream of Tartar (The Stabilizer)
* **⅛ tsp** Sea Salt

## Execution Protocol

### 1. The Separation (Critical)
* Separate the eggs carefully.
* **Constraint:** Not a single speck of yolk can get into the whites. Fat destroys the protein foam structure.

### 2. The Yolk Mixture (The Flavor)
* In Bowl A: Mix **3 Egg Yolks**, **3 Tbsp Cream Cheese**, and **Salt**.
* Whisk until perfectly smooth and no lumps remain.

### 3. The White Structure (The Lift)
* In Bowl B: Add **3 Egg Whites** and **¼ tsp Cream of Tartar**.
* **Action:** Beat with an electric mixer on HIGH.
* **Target State:** "Stiff Peaks." When you lift the beater, the foam should stand straight up like a mountain peak and not fold over.

### 4. The Folding (The Integration)
* **Technique:** Gently *fold* the yolk mixture into the white foam.
* **Do not stir.** Stirring crushes the air bubbles you just created. Slice through the middle and flip over. Repeat until just combined (yellow streaks are fine).

### 5. The Bake
* Preheat oven to **300°F (150°C)**. (Note: Low temp is required to dry it out without burning).
* Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
* Scoop **6 dollops** of the mixture onto the paper. Flatten slightly with the back of a spoon.
* Bake for **25–30 minutes**.
* **Pull Point:** Golden brown on the surface.

## Storage Note
* **Fresh:** They are slightly crisp like a meringue.
* **Next Day:** Store in a Ziploc bag overnight. They absorb moisture and become soft and chewy, closely resembling standard white bread texture.
