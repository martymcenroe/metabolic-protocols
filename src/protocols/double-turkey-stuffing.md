## Protocol Overview
A Zero-Carb "Forcemeat" stuffing designed to replace bread-based stuffings. Uses ground turkey as the base matrix and incorporates low-carb vegetables for texture ("crunch") and moisture retention.

## Ingredients

### The Matrix (Base)
* **1 lb** Ground Turkey (85% lean / 15% fat preferred).
* **1** Large Egg (Binder).
* **½ Cup** Grated Parmesan Cheese (Moisture absorber/Binder).
* **2 Tbsp** Fresh Herbs (Sage, Rosemary, Thyme - chopped).
* **½ tsp** Salt.
* **½ tsp** Black Pepper.

### Optional Add-ins (Choose 1 or 2 types)
* **½ Cup Celery Stalks:** Finely diced. Adds classic crunch.
* **½ Cup Fennel Bulb:** Finely diced. Adds anise flavor (mimics Italian sausage) and crunch.
* **½ Cup Riced Cauliflower:** Thawed and squeezed dry. Acts as a breadcrumb/rice replacement for bulk.
* **½ Cup Radishes:** Chopped into small cubes. When roasted, the spicy bite vanishes, creating a texture similar to roasted potatoes.
* **½ Cup Mushrooms:** Finely chopped. Absorbs fat and adds savory "umami" depth.
* **¼ Cup Giblets (Heart/Gizzard):** *Must be pre-cooked.* Simmer for 60 mins until tender, then chop fine.

## Execution Protocol

### 1. Pre-Processing (Vegetables & Giblets)
* **Vegetables:** Ensure all added vegetables are chopped to the same size as the ground meat (approx ¼ inch) to ensure uniform cooking.
* **Giblet Simmer:** If using gizzards/hearts, place in a small pot with water. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to **Low**. Maintain a "simmer" (lazy bubbles breaking surface, not violent boiling) for 1 hour to tenderize. Chop fine.

### 2. The Mix
* In a large bowl, combine the **Ground Turkey**, **Egg**, **Parmesan**, **Herbs**, and **Seasoning**.
* Fold in your selected **Optional Add-ins**.
* Mix by hand until the mixture becomes tacky/sticky and holds its shape.

### 3. The Stuffing
* **Constraint:** Do not pack tightly. The stuffing expands slightly as the meat cooks.
* Loosely fill the main cavity of the turkey with the mixture.

### 4. The Roast
* Roast the turkey according to standard protocols (e.g., Roasting Bag).
* **Critical Safety Check:** The bird is not done until the **center of the stuffing** reads **165°F (74°C)**.
* *Note:* This typically adds 15-30 minutes to the total cooking time compared to an unstuffed bird.
