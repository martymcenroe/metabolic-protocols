## Protocol Overview
A high-fat, zero-carb execution of the classic French *Oeufs Brouillés*. Utilizes the "Pre-Salting" technique to denature proteins for maximum moisture retention and heavy cream for thermal protection.

## Ingredients
* **6** Large Eggs
* **6 Tbsp** Heavy Whipping Cream (1 Tbsp per egg)
* **½ tsp** Kosher Salt (strictly measured)
* **2 Tbsp** Grated Parmesan Cheese
* **1 Tbsp** Butter (for the pan)

## Execution Protocol

### 1. The Pre-Salt (Critical Step)
* Crack **6 eggs** into a bowl.
* Add **½ tsp Kosher Salt**.
* Whisk vigorously until combined.
* **Wait:** Let the mixture sit undisturbed for **15 minutes**.
    * *Mechanism:* Salt dissolves protein bonds, preventing syneresis (water loss) during cooking.

### 2. The Emulsion
* After the 15-minute rest, pour in the **6 Tbsp Heavy Cream**.
* Add the **2 Tbsp Parmesan**.
* Whisk again to fully incorporate the fat into the egg matrix.

### 3. The Low-Heat Cook
* Place a non-stick skillet over **LOW** heat.
* Melt **1 Tbsp Butter**.
* Pour in the egg mixture.
* **Technique:** Stir constantly with a silicone spatula. Move the eggs around the pan; do not let them sit.
* **Pull Point:** Remove from heat when the eggs look *slightly wet* and soft curds have formed. Residual heat will finish them on the plate.

## Failure Modes
* **High Heat:** Will cause the cream to break (separate into oil) and eggs to become rubbery.
* **Skipping the Rest:** Result will be drier, "weeping" eggs.
