## Protocol Overview
The fundamental bread replacement for the zero-carb diet. Creates a rigid, crispy structure suitable for sandwiches or "toast" points. Relies on the Maillard reaction of cheese and the structural binding of egg protein.

## Ingredients
* **1** Large Egg
* **½ Cup** Shredded Cheese (Mozzarella for crispest/neutral; Cheddar for softer/flavorful)
* **Optional:** 1 tsp Almond Flour (for cake texture - not strictly zero carb)
* **Optional:** Everything Bagel Seasoning (for savory buns)

## Execution Protocol

### 1. The Pre-Heat
* Plug in the Mini Waffle Maker.
* **Status Check:** Wait for the light to indicate full heat.

### 2. The Batter
* In a small bowl, crack the **Egg**.
* Add the **Shredded Cheese**.
* Whisk with a fork until fully combined.

### 3. The Cook
* Pour the batter into the center of the hot iron.
* Close the lid.
* **Duration:** 3 to 4 minutes.
* **Visual Queue:** Do not open until steam stops escaping from the sides.
* **Status Check:** Waffle should be deep golden brown.

### 4. The Rest (Critical)
* Remove chaffle carefully with a fork.
* Place on a **Wire Rack** for 60 seconds.
* *Mechanism:* The cheese must cool slightly to recrystallize and become crispy. If placed directly on a plate, trapped steam will make it soggy.

## Failure Modes
* **Soggy:** Skipped the cooling rack step.
* **Tearing:** Opened the iron before the steam stopped (batter was still wet).
